# Member-Survey Status Notification
{: .no_toc }

These Notifications are used to securely inform Toluna of a Member's end-status within a Survey. In addition to sending these calls, the Client should also redirect the member to the appropriate endpage as described [here](/s2sClientRedirectGuide/servertoserver/redirectingMember.html).

> IMPORTANT
>
> Ensure all API requests originate from the Client Survey side and utilize HTTPS for secure communication
