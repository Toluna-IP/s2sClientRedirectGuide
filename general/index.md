## RESTful API for Member-Survey Status Notification

Toluna offers a RESTful API that allows clients to communicate the status of a Member-Survey upon its completion. This integration ensures accurate tracking and reporting of Survey outcomes.

### Redirect URL

In addition to the API call, Members must be redirected back to Toluna using a specified URL. This redirection should occur simultaneously with the API call.
